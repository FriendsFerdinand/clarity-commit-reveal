# clarity-commit-reveal

I wanted to get this up so that the sBTC Clarity WG can take a look at the 
concept. Currently mostly untested. Please post comments in #1.

I will update the README and bring it over to the right repository once we know
where exactly we want to put it.

There are some changes to `clarity-bitcoin`. I therefore named it v5 for now.
The main change is the addition of txid calculation for segwit transactions.

Please do not copy over any code to other repositories just yet. Let us do that
in a structured way.
